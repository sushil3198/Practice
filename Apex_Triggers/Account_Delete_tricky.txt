The trigger will prevent the users from deleting the Accounts. This is because System Administrator has all the permissions, we cannot change the permissions.

object : Account
event: before
dml : delete

trigger PreventAccDeleteTrigger on Account (before delete)
{

	for(Account a : trigger.old)
	{
		if(trigger.isDelete)
		a.addError('This account cannot be deleted');
	}
}
