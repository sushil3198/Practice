Write a trigger whenever a user is deactivated, its Accounts,Contacts, Opportunites must be transfered to user's Manager
Consider that User has a manager already assigned. Also keep in mind mixed DML exception.

For now I am writing Logic inside Trigger itself. Please consider writing a Utility class and use Future methods.


Object : User
Event : After
DML : Update
Logic : Iterate over Trigger.new and check isActive == true or false.
		Fetch the Id of User and using SOQL fetch Accounts WHERE OwnerId = UserId
		Iterate over accounts and update the account Owner with user's Manager.
		Once you update the accounts, Contacts and Opps owners will be updated automatically.
		
Trigger MassTransferUserTrigger on User(after update){

	Set<Id> userIdSet = new Set<Id>();
	for(user usr : Trigger.new){
		if(usr.isActive != Trigger.oldMap.get(usr.Id).isActive && usr.isActive == false){
			userIdSet.add(usr.Id);
		}
	}
	
	
	List<Account> accList = [Select OwnerId from Account WHERE OwnerId IN :uerIdSet];
	
	if(!accList.isEmpty()){
		for(Account acc : accList){
			acc.OwnerId = Trigger.newMap.get(acc.OwnerId).ManagerId;
		}
		update accList;
	}
}
