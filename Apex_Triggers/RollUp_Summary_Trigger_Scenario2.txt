I have book and author objects. Author is parent and book is child and they are linked using lookup.
I want to count total number of books written by an Author. On Author, we should be able to view number of books.


object : book
event : after
dml  : insert, update, delete, undelete

trigger updateRollUpTrigger on Book__c (after insert, after delete, after undelete){
	
	if(trigger.isInsert || trigger.isDelete || trigger.isUndelete){
		HelperClass.helperMethod(trigger.new, trigger.old);
	}
}




Helper Class

public class HelperClass {
	
	public static void helperMethod(List<Book__c> newBookList, oldBookList){
		
		Set<Id> authorIdSet = new Set<Id>();z

		if(newBookList.size() > 0 && newBookList != null){
			for(Book__c b  : newBookList){
				authorIdSet.add(b.AuthodId__c);
			}
		}

		if(oldBookList.size() > 0 && oldBookList != null){
			for(Book__c b : oldBookList){
				authorIdSet.add(b.AuthorId__c);
			}
		}

		List<Author__c> authorList = [Select Id, numberOfBooks__c, (Select Id from Books) from Author__c WHERE Id IN :authorIdSet];

		for(Author__c a : authorList){
			a.numberOfBooks__c = a.books.size();
		}

		update authorList;
	}
}
