Question 1) If we want to deactivate a user who is a part of Account Team. Will I be able to deactivate a user? If yes,
			then will the user be removed from Account team automatically or it has to be a manual step?
			
Answer 1) Yes, I will be able to deactivate the user. The user will be removed from Account Team automatically because as soon as we
		  deactivate the user we see a prompt which says, deactivating a user will remove the user from all delegated Groups. Also,
		  user will be removed from all the teams.
		  
Question 2) If we are using a before save flow & we want to access the Formula field for the current record, will I be able to access
			that formula field? If no, then what will be the workaround?
			
Answer 2) No, we won't be able to access the formula field for current record. We can fetch prior value of forumal field but cannot access
		  current value. As a workaround, we can create formula variable in Flow, and mimic the foumula field logic within the flow which
		  will help us to access the formula value in before save flow itself.
